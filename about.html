            <p class="biog about__text">
                As a painter, I often hear people ask me how long a painting takes to finish.  My answer is always my entire
                life.  When reflect on my career as a UX designer and all the steps that I’ve taken to get where I am today,
                my answer is the same.  Coming from a background as an artist and a teacher, I’ve been building the skills to
                be a designer my entire life. </p>

                 <p class="biog about__text">
                     I’ll never forget winning a local art contest at 5 years old and proudly displaying my drippy watercolor
                     in a local bank.  From that point on, I decided I wanted to be an artist.  In high school, after taking a
                     digital design class, I had become the “in house” designer for my friends.  Before I knew it I was creating
                     Photoshop templates for my friend’s online journals.  Once I figured out how to make them, then I started teaching
                     myself how to code.  I would hunt for features that I loved in other websites, and figured out how to do it myself.
                 </p>

                <p class="biog about__text">
                    I thought coding and design was a fun hobby to do for my friends as a teen, but I didn't understand teenage hobbies
                    could be careers as an adult. When I thought about creating websites for a job, I thought about math geniuses who
                    grew up glued to a computer.  Math wasn’t my strongest subject and didn’t have a computer until my first day of
                    college.  Over the next ten years, I dreamed about pursuing a career as a designer.  I got as far as signing up for a
                    web design class after college, but never kept going.  I always needed to put my designer dreams on the back burner
                    for a little bit longer. </p>

                    <h1 class="bio__headline">Educating the User Experience </h1>

                <p class="biog about__text">
                    Many years, lots of hesitation, and two degrees later, I became an art teacher. I loved watching my students
                     grow and readjusting my lessons class after class so that most amount of students could thrive.  A few
                     years in to teaching, I had a lull where I was working only part-time. I realized that this was the perfect
                      opportunity to learn more Graphic Design. so I enrolled in a few classes and started refreshing my
                      knowledge of code in my spare time. </p>
                      <h1 class="bio__headline">A Hobby Turned Passion </h1>

                <p class="biog about__text">
                    I thought Graphic Design would help me learn a new tool and get me up to date on Photoshop, but I never
                     thought I would change my career completely.  I knew a lot of teachers who became designers, but I felt
                     like I loved improving student's lives too much for that.  Learning about UX changed my mind completely.  A
                     combination of design, research, human psychology and technology seemed like it spoke to all the hats I'd been longing
                     to wear at work.  Soon after,  I enrolled in an apprenticeship through Bloc.</p>

                <p class="biog about__text">
                    Bloc, with their project based learning and guided mentorship helped me learn the skills I needed to create beautiful
                    and functional applications centered around user needs and pain points. These skills have left me excited and empowered
                    to use my design skills to help people with great ideas share their passions with the most diverse audience possible. </p>
