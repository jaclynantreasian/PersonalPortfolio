            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p>Managing your content on cloud storage can be a cluttered and disorganized experience.
             Cloud storage services are generally lacking in versatility or trying to do too many things
             at once.  Because of this, users find themselves juggling between many cloud storage sites.
            Gather strives to simplify cloud storage by making it easy to keep your content all in one place.</p>

            <article class="solution">
                <h5>Solution</h5>
                <p>Gather gives you more time to focus on what matters with intuitive organization, seamless
                    collaboration and versatile uploading, all in one place.  With Gather you can upload any
                    time of file and organize it with visual folders and categories.  Sharing and content

            <h2 class="heading"> Discovery </h2>
            <h5 class="subhead">User survey</h5>
            <p>
                Coming up with Gather had to begin by understanding cloud storage users needs and pain points.
                In my user survey I wanted to figure out:</p>
            <p>
                What did users love about cloud storage?
                What features are actually used in cloud storage apps, and what is filler?
                get a sense of where their frustrations were when using cloud storage.
            </p>
            <p class="infographics">
                79% of users use Google Drive for cloud storage
            </p>
            <p class="infographics">
                39% of users liked the idea of having all their files in one place
            </p>
            <p class="infographics">
                27% said it was hard to keep their cloud storage organized</p>
            <p>
                After completing the survey, I realized that users really needed a cloud storage app that could
                meet their expectations of organization and versatility.  The ability to create content, upload
                any type of file and have robust sharing features was what users weren’t finding in the
                current cloud storage market.  Juggling multiple apps was too complicated and leaving them
                disorganized and frustrated.

                <h5 class="subhead">User Personas</h5>
                <p>
                    To get an idea of the needs of different users, I developed some user personas. Julie the teacher, needs an easy way to share files with her coworkers and students.
                    Roger needs a collaborative sharing experience for his freelance business. Forgetful Randy is a busy student who
                    doesn't have lots of time to learn a new piece of software and wishes cloud storage wasn't so complicated.

                    Based on the results from the survey and using my user personas as a base, I went ahead and created
                    some user stories to help prioritize features and define the scope of the project.

                <p>
                    To keep the user experience as smooth as possible, user flows were made.
                    These user flows focused on smooth sign up, sharing and uploading.
                    These flows became the backbone for my prototypes moving forward.

                <h5 class="subhead">Wireframes and Testing</h5>
                <p>
                    I created Low-fidelity wireframes using Invision and tested them with a
                     usability test script for 3 different users.  I wanted my tests to feature
                     ease of onboarding, uploading and moving content. While users had an easy
                     experience signing up and uploading, some users showed hesitation while
                     moving content.  As I moved towards future iterations, I added some
                     iconography for the move feature.

                     <p>
                     Before I went on to higher fidelity prototypes, it was time to get a feel
                     for the brand’s vision and style. I knew the brand mission centered around
                     bringing together people and content.   After lots of brainstorming,
                     the name Gather formed. The community feel of Gather lended itself to a
                     script font. Lobster was a perfect pairing for the vintage togetherness
                     that is at the core of Gather’s brand.  Open sans as a supporting text was
                     friendly, airy and easy to read.

                 Still not sure of a few aspects of my design, I got the help
                 of the public to help me with some final preference tests.
                 I tested a folder design, features page and nav bar design on
                 Usability Hub, with 32 responses here are the results:

             <p>
                 Our high fidelity prototypes went through many design iterations based on user
                 feedback.  During our first round of testing  users felt the iconography was
                 hard to read, but when we made it bigger the design looked cluttered.  For our
                 next iteration we simplified to a single icon which opened a drop down menu. Many
                 design iterations later, users had a smooth experience uploading and organizing
                 their content on the app.

            <h5 class="subhead">Future Improvements</h5>
            <p>
                Cloud storage has gone in a lot of exciting directions lately, with new features
                 added daily. Given the limited scope of the project, there were a lot of
                 features that would benefit further research and exploration, especially
                 around content creation and sharing.  Given further time I would love further
                 flesh out these concepts and see what features would be beneficial in the future.
            </p>
            <h5 class="subhead">Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
                Working through Gather helped me gain confidence in the iterative process of design.  Creating
                an app that centered around user content was challenging. After completing many rounds of user
                feedback and design iterations, I was able to make a cloud storage app with a smooth user
                experience.
