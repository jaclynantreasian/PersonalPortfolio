            <p class="paragraph_white">Managing your content on cloud storage can be a cluttered and disorganized experience.
             Cloud storage services are generally lacking in versatility or trying to do too many things
             at once.  Because of this, users find themselves juggling between many cloud storage sites.
            Gather strives to simplify cloud storage by making it easy to keep your content all in one place.</p>

                Coming up with Gather had to begin by understanding cloud storage users needs and pain points.
                In my user survey I wanted to figure out both what users loved about cloud storage and where their specific pain points were.
                Since cloud storage is a relatively new market, I was also interested in seeing what features users would like to see in the future and which ones they could do without.

                After completing the survey, I realized that users really needed a cloud storage app that could
                meet their expectations of organization and versatility.  The ability to create content, upload
                any type of file and have robust sharing features was what users weren’t finding in the
                current cloud storage market.  Juggling multiple apps was too complicated and leaving them
                disorganized and frustrated.

                 Still not sure of a few aspects of my design, I got the help
                 of the public to help me with some final preference tests.
                 I tested a folder design, features page and nav bar design on
                 Usability Hub, with 32 responses here are the results:

             <p class="paragraph__text">
                 Our high fidelity prototypes went through many design iterations based on user
                 feedback.  During our first round of testing  users felt the iconography was
                 hard to read, but when we made it bigger the design looked cluttered.  For our
                 next iteration we simplified to a single icon which opened a drop down menu. Many
                 design iterations later, users had a smooth experience uploading and organizing
                 their content on the app.

        <h5 class="paragraph__headline">Sign Up Page</h5>

        <p class="paragraph__text">
            Sign up was easy to execute and many users were excited about the
            opportunity to sign up via faceboook, something most testers expressed
            that was their preferred sign up.  On the other hand, users expressed that the main
            image on the sign up page didn’t connect with the brand message.  I also received feedback
            that for sign up forms, putting the sign in prompts on top of the input fields rather than
            inside was an even easier user experience.  After making those changes users were delighted
            with a seamless and easy sign up process that left the excited to try the new app.</p>

           <h5 class="paragraph__headline">User Dashboard</h5>
         <p class="paragraph__text">
           Users thought the design was inviting but wanted more room for content, so Instead of
           the large buttons at the top I added a smaller button on the side of the page for users
            to add and upload new content from there, furthermore I shrunk the nav heading and logo
            while also expanding the search bar.  User feedback thought the icons made moving and
            sharing files easy, but design wise they said it felt tight so I condensed the icons
            into a small drop down menu so it was still easy to navigate but maintained a clean
            and easy to use interface </p>

            <p class="paragraph__text">
                Working through Gather helped me gain confidence in the iterative process of design.  Creating
                an app that centered around user content was challenging. After completing many rounds of user
                feedback and design iterations, I was able to make a cloud storage app with a smooth user
                experience.
