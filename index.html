                <h5>Art Education</h5>
                <p>During my experience as an art educator, I constantly iterating
                    lessons and presentations to meet the needs of the most diverse
                    group of learners through not only verbal feedback but body
                    language and performance tasks.  Tailoring succesful lessons
                    also requires the ability to balance the big picture and small
                    details at the same time.  Critical aspects of any UX project.</p>

                <h5>Fine Art</h5>
                <p>As an artist, I used my extensive knowledge of art and design to create colorful
                    abstract paintings as well as using my knowledge of marketing to help maintain my
                    small business.  Understanding user needs, communicating your unique idea and
                    content strategy are all important parts of running a fine art business.</p>
