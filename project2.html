                Out of the 64 responses we got, I noticed that a lot of people use weather apps for their main way to get the weather, but were frustrated with a clunky design filled 
                with information they didn't need yet the apps didn't have the local coverage they are looking for.  Users loved the idea of having
                in depth storm analysis and live lightning, but most weren't interested in marine data.  My client disagreed and thought that the survey was 
                missing the many requests he had gotten over the years, and felt that coastal weather was a big focus of the North Shore culture.  
                He decided to keep that information regardless of the user data I collected.

                    doesn&apos;t have lots of time to learn a new piece of software and wishes cloud storage wasn&apos;t so complicated.

                     experience signing up and uploading, some users showed hesitation while

                     Before I went on to higher fidelity prototypes, it was time to get a feel
                     for the brand&apos;s vision and style. I knew the brand mission centered around
                     bringing together people and content.   After lots of brainstorming,
                     the name Gather formed. The community feel of Gather lended itself to a
                     script font. Lobster was a perfect pairing for the vintage togetherness
                     that is at the core of Gather&apos;s brand.  Open Sans as a supporting text was
                     friendly, airy and easy to read.

                 Still not sure of a few aspects of my design, I got the help
                 of the public to help me with some final preference tests.
                 I tested a folder design, features page and nav bar design on
                 Usability Hub, with 32 responses here are the results:

             <p class="paragraph__text">
                 Our high fidelity prototypes went through many design iterations based on user
                 feedback.  During our first round of testing  users felt the iconography was
                 hard to read, but when we made it bigger the design looked cluttered.  For our
                 next iteration we simplified to a single icon which opened a drop down menu. Many
                 design iterations later, users had a smooth experience uploading and organizing
                 their content on the app.

        <p class="paragraph__text">
            Sign up was easy to execute and many users were excited about the
            opportunity to sign up via faceboook, something most testers expressed
            that was their preferred sign up.  On the other hand, users expressed that the main
            image on the sign up page didn’t connect with the brand message.  I also received feedback
            that for sign up forms, putting the sign in prompts on top of the input fields rather than
            inside was an even easier user experience.  After making those changes users were delighted
            with a seamless and easy sign up process that left the excited to try the new app.</p>

           <h5 class="paragraph__headline">User Dashboard</h5>
         <p class="paragraph__text">
           Users thought the design was inviting but wanted more room for content, so Instead of
           the large buttons at the top I added a smaller button on the side of the page for users
            to add and upload new content from there, furthermore I shrunk the nav heading and logo
            while also expanding the search bar.  User feedback thought the icons made moving and
            sharing files easy, but design wise they said it felt tight so I condensed the icons
            into a small drop down menu so it was still easy to navigate but maintained a clean
            and easy to use interface </p>

            <p class="paragraph__text">
                Working through Gather helped me gain confidence in the iterative process of design.  Creating
                an app that centered around user content was challenging. After completing many rounds of user
                feedback and design iterations, I was able to make a cloud storage app with a smooth user
                experience.
