            <p class='paragraph__text'>
            When my client first invited me on board with his project, he told me was nearly complete and only needed a logo and perhaps some icons to finish.  Once I installed and troubleshot the app, I found a plethora of major usability issues.  The usability issues combined with my client's need to launch this app as soon as possible due to budget issues, made this project a real test in problem solving and unveiling the biggest UX problems to fix.  When I first opened the page on the website I encountered an unauthorized page and knew I had lots of work to do </p>

            After a complete assessment I uncovered numerous usability issues, with these three being the most major.            </p>             

            <ul class="paragraph__text">
            <li>The current conditions map defaults to the closest weather statiion but doesn't show the user's location, this can confuse users. </li>
  			<li>the home screen has a width over 100% and the user has the ability to scroll left and right.</li>
  			<li> The menu for app navigation is incredibly long and can condensed to provide optimal usability when switching between numerous weather forecasts. </li>
  			<li>weather maps are also very difficult to navigate, with a higher maximum width and not defaulting to the user's current area.</li>

                My client felt he had a good idea of what his users were looking for, after years of getting requests for an app and app features.
                I recommended we still do a survey and put it out to his 8K followers to get a better idea of where their pain points were, 
                and what features would be great to include in the new app.

                Out of the 64 responses we got, I noticed that a lot of people use weather apps for their main way to get the weather, but were frustrated with a clunky design filled 
                with information they didn't need yet the apps didn't have the local coverage they are looking for.  Users loved the idea of having
                in depth storm analysis and live lightning, and we decided in depth storm coverage would be an important feature of the app.

            <p class='paragraph__text'>
                Considering the responses to the survey, I needed a little more information on our competitors.  I did an indepth competitive analysis of The Weather Channel App, Accuweather app and a local news app.  What I found was lots of ads and cluttered content that didn't focus to on local weater (especially with the Weather Channel app, which the majority of respondants use), text that was incredibly difficult to read (WCVB) and with accuweather hard to understand and interpret forecasts.  Users needed a legible, relevant and easy to understand app with lots of relevant content with a focus on understanding the science behind big storms and an emphasis on local weather.  After the competitive analysis my client and I were confident we could create an effective app for his uers.
